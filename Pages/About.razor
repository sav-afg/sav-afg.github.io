                        I'm a Computer Science student with a strong focus on .NET backend development and system design, building practical applications that solve real problems. I enjoy working close to the logic layer by designing APIs, enforcing business rules, and writing code that is structured, testable, and maintainable.

                    <p class="text-muted">
                        Alongside my studies, I regularly build full-stack and backend-heavy projects using C#, ASP.NET Core, Blazor, and SQL Server, taking ownership from initial requirements through to implementation and testing. I'm particularly interested in authentication, authorization, data modelling, and clean architecture, and I place a strong emphasis on correctness over surface-level polish.

                    <p class="text-muted mb-0">
                        I have experience building applications end-to-end, from designing data models and APIs to implementing business logic and validating behaviour through automated tests. I prioritise clarity, separation of concerns, and explicit decision-making, and I actively avoid unnecessary complexity unless it serves a clear purpose.

                    <p class="text-muted mb-3">
                        I started coding out of an interest in problem-solving and logical systems, such as in maths and computer science where I enjoyed breaking complex problems down into clear, structured solutions. Programming appealed to me because it offers immediate, tangible feedback in how you design a set of rules, and the system either behaves correctly or it doesn't.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted mb-3">
                        What drew me further into software development was the ability to combine theory with practical impact: applying mathematical reasoning and analytical thinking to build real systems that people can use. Over time, this led me toward backend development, where correctness, data integrity, and well-defined behaviour matter more than subjective design choices.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted mb-0">
                        Alongside development, I stay active through regular gym training and running, which helps me maintain discipline and focus.

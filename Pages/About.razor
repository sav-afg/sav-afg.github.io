            <p>
                I’m a Computer Science student with a strong focus on .NET backend development and system design, building practical applications that solve real problems. I enjoy working close to the logic layer by designing APIs, enforcing business rules, and writing code that is structured, testable, and maintainable.

                Alongside my studies, I regularly build full-stack and backend-heavy projects using C#, ASP.NET Core, Blazor, and SQL Server, taking ownership from initial requirements through to implementation and testing. I’m particularly interested in authentication, authorization, data modelling, and clean architecture, and I place a strong emphasis on correctness over surface-level polish.

            <h2>Experience and Approach</h2>
            <p>
                I have experience building applications end-to-end, from designing data models and APIs to implementing business logic and validating behaviour through automated tests. I prioritise clarity, separation of concerns, and explicit decision-making, and I actively avoid unnecessary complexity unless it serves a clear purpose.

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>
Apart from coding and software development, I enjoy being active and go to the gym and jogs regularly. I also have a strong interest in the subjects i study (maths, physics and computer science) and dedicate time refining my skills in these areas.
